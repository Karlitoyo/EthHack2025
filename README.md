# 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 KinChain

**KinChain** is a decentralized identity protocol designed to help individuals prove **family relationships—across generations—without revealing sensitive data**. Using **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** and **hashed verifiable credentials**, users can privately and securely validate their connection to parents, children, or grandparents. 

KinChain anchors verified relationship claims **on-chain**, enabling users to build a lifelong, cryptographic family tree for use in **immigration, legal documentation**, and **cross-border services**. It empowers diaspora communities and stateless individuals to gain trust and access global services without relying on centralized authorities.

## 📘 Description

KinChain leverages modern cryptography to enable **trustless and privacy-preserving verification of family relationships**. The protocol:

- Uses **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** to validate relationships without exposing personal data.
- Anchors verified claims **on-chain** to create a cryptographic family tree.
- Enables institutions to accept these proofs without requiring sensitive documentation.
- Supports long-term identity building, especially for marginalized or displaced individuals.

Built using **Nest.js** (backend) and **Next.js** (frontend), KinChain offers a scalable, modular, and secure infrastructure that respects **user privacy**, **data minimization**, and **institutional interoperability**.

## ❗ Business Problem

Current identity systems are:

- **Centralized** and vulnerable to manipulation.
- **Not interoperable** across jurisdictions.
- **Invasive**—requiring submission of personal, sensitive documents.
- **Unavailable** to millions of stateless or displaced individuals.

There is no decentralized method to **trustlessly prove familial relationships** while preserving user privacy and data sovereignty.

KinChain solves these challenges by offering:

- Verifiable and private proofs of family relationships.
- Cryptographic lineage anchored to blockchain.
- A user-controlled identity model.

## 🧑‍💼 User Stories

### 👪 Diaspora User
> Needs to prove a family connection for immigration purposes but lacks access to centralized records.  
✅ Uses KinChain to create and share a ZKP-based proof of relationship with a parent—accepted by immigration authorities.

---

### 👴 Grandparent Claim  
> Needs to prove connection to a grandchild for inheritance but doesn't want to share sensitive personal data.  
✅ Verifiable credentials from the parent link both generations in a privacy-preserving, on-chain relationship tree.

---

### 🧾 Stateless or Refugee Individual  
> Lost official documents due to conflict and displacement.  
✅ Reconstructs identity through trusted relative attestations and cryptographic verification on KinChain.

---
